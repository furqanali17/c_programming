# c_programming
Two projects which I worked on in C.
# word guessing game
In this game you guess a word which should consist of 5 letters and be part of a premade word dictionary. You have several tries and statstics are also taken.
# asteriods game
In this game you program a ship to move through an asteriod field and achieve the highest score possible.
